>[!TIP]
>A cycle in a graph is a path where:
>- The starting vertex and the ending vertex are the same.
>- No edge or vertex (except the starting/ending vertex) is repeated.

### Example of a Cycle:
- In a graph with vertices A,B,C and edges (A->B),(B->C),(C->A), there is a cycle:
  - Path of A->B->C->A
### Types of Cycles:
- Directed Cycle: All edges in the cycle are directed (e.g. A->B->C->A)
- Undirected Cycle: The edges do not have direction
