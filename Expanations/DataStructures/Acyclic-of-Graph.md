### Examples of Acyclic Graphs:
- 1.Tree: A tree is a type of acyclic graph where all vertices are connected and there is exactly one path between any two vertices.
- 2.DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): A directed graph with no cycles. DAGs are used in scenarios like task scheduling, dependency resolution, and version control systems (e.g., Git).
